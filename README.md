### Dependencies

Before running the script, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can run the script using the command line. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

```bash
python crackftp.py --host <FTP_HOST> --user <USERNAME_LIST> --pass <PASSWORD_LIST>
```

- **`<FTP_HOST>`**: The target FTP server address.
- **`<USERNAME_LIST>`**: A file containing usernames to test.
- **`<PASSWORD_LIST>`**: A file containing passwords to test.

### Example

```bash
python crackftp.py --host ftp.example.com --user users.txt --pass passwords.txt
```

This command will test the usernames and passwords listed in the specified files against the FTP server at `ftp.example.com`.

## Telegram Notifications

To enable Telegram notifications, you need to set up a bot. Follow these steps:

1. Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather".
2. Create a new bot and note down the API token.
3. Get your chat ID by sending a message to your bot and using the API to retrieve it.

Once you have both the API token and chat ID, add them to your configuration file. 

```json
{
  "telegram_token": "YOUR_API_TOKEN",
  "chat_id": "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
}
```

Now, whenever a successful login occurs, you will receive a notification in Telegram.
